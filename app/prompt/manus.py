    "1. Use appropriate tools to complete the task practically (e.g., create files, run code, browse web)\n"

Consider what the user is asking for and determine the best approach:
- If they want something created (files, code, web pages), use tools like str_replace_editor or python_execute
- If they need information or guidance, you can respond directly
- For web-related tasks, consider using browser tools
- Break complex tasks into clear, logical steps

Explain your reasoning and what you're going to do before taking action.
Use the `terminate` tool when the task is complete or if you need to stop.
