# Tool-Calling and Timeout Optimization

This document explains the optimizations made to address tool-calling failures and timeout issues in the system.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Tool-Calling Implementation
- Identified that the `ask_tool` method was missing from the LLM class
- This was a critical root cause of the agent's failure to execute tool calls
- The agent was generating text responses instead of structured tool calls

### 2. Timeout and Cancellation Handling
- Enhanced timeout handling to return partial results when possible
- Added more detailed logging for timeout diagnostics
- Implemented graceful degradation instead of hard failures

### 3. Tool Call Parsing
- Added robust parsing of tool calls from model responses
- Implemented multiple pattern recognition for different tool call formats
- Ensured proper JSON handling and error recovery

## Implementation Details

The optimizations are implemented in two key files:

1. `app/llm_tool_patch.py`:
   - Implements the missing `ask_tool` method
   - Adds tool call parsing functionality
   - Enhances timeout handling with partial results

2. `app/cleanup.py`:
   - Implements signal handlers for graceful interruption
   - Ensures proper resource cleanup on exit
   - Prevents cascading exceptions during interruption

## Integration

These optimizations are integrated through:

1. Monkey patching the LLM class with the missing methods
2. Registering signal and exit handlers for cleanup
3. Ensuring proper initialization order in the main application

## Expected Improvements

- Agent will now properly execute tool calls instead of just generating text
- Timeouts will be handled gracefully with partial results when possible
- Interruptions will clean up resources properly
- System will be more stable and responsive overall
